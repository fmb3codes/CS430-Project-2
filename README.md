 This application is intended to take in a .json scene file and properly write it out to a .ppm file (of P6 format as recommended by the professor).

 There are no special notes regarding the usage of the program; the program can be built from the makefile and commands should be sent
according to the usage pattern given in the project criteria. The program assumes that a properly formatted json input file
should be passed to the command line and that it should also exist, but there is error checking in the case that it doesn't. Also, if
the output file specified does not exist, then one will be created. Also included the example json file for reference which has been checked against to validate the correct .ppm file output.
